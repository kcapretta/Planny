Segment work easily — giving in to my main addiction: organization. I’ve personalized this application to specifically show the projects, interests and activities that I am currently focused on.

## Insights & Ideation
I designed and translated concepts into features that addressed my needs, paying close attention to the intuitiveness that an Apple Watch required. 

## Experience Strategy & Vision
I created the wireframe as well as the framework to share the vision and streamline the process.

## Planning & Scope Definition
Designing and the application, understanding the work that needed to be done and planning accordingly were all stepping stones within this process.

The framework of the application as it might appear on the Apple Watch. I based it off of simplicity and positive reinforcement: encouraging positive timelines and celebration.

As I proceeded in the development of this application, I did what I could to increase the visual interest and how in-tune with my current state that I would want to be while using the app. I wanted this to be visually fun, making work into an adventure and a mission to complete. 


## Hindsight
The final product was incredibly enlightening and something that I am very proud of. Learning how to adapt to the strange world of the Apple Watch is something I will not soon forget. Because of the Watch being a new technology, it is not yet equal with all of the capabilities of a usual iPhone application. I had to create plenty of work-arounds with the constraints of such a small screen. After a time, the constraints became freeing: it was based more about how I could streamline the space, given what I had. 

I am excited to say that the application not only features a countdown timer, but a specified Apple Watch table row, as well as a frame-by-frame animation on a timer. There is also the capacity for a JSON API call, and the ability for SiriKit Intents as well. All-in-all, this was a great experience and I feel like I’ve learned an entirely new framework.
